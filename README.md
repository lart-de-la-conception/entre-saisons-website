This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Password-protecting `/products` (temporary gate)

This project includes a simple password gate for the `/products` collection (and all `/products/*` routes).

### Local setup

Add these to your environment (for example in `.env.local`):

- `PRODUCTS_PASSWORD`: the password you want to type on `/products/login`
- `PRODUCTS_GATE_TOKEN`: a random string used as the auth cookie value (generate anything long-ish)

After you set them, visit `/products` and you’ll be redirected to `/products/login`.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
